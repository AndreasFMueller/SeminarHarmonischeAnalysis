  abstract = {Optical systems, which inherently possess two degrees of freedom rather than the single degree of freedom available in a single electronic channel, appear to offer some advantages over their electronic counterparts for certain applications.
              
              
              
              Coherent optical systems have the added property that one may easily obtain many successive two-dimensional Fourier transforms of any given light amplitude distribution, or, by use of astigmatic optics, one-dimensional transforms can be obtained. Therefore, most linear operations of an integral transform nature are easily implemented. The optical implementation of integral transform which are of importance to communication theory is discussed; the general problems of optical filter synthesis and multichannel computation and data processing are introduced, followed by a discussion of potential applications. Astigmatic systems, which permit multichannel operation in lieu of two-dimensional processing, are treated as a special case of general two-dimensional processors. Complex input functions are discussed with relation to their role in coherent optical systems.},

@article{opt:GuilletdeChatellus.2016,
  abstract = {Real-time Fourier transformation (RTFT) of signals is a fundamental concept that enables Fourier analysis at speeds beyond the limitations of conventional digital signal processing engines. In the optical domain, RTFT is commonly performed by inducing large amounts of group-velocity dispersion on the signal (time-varying light wave) of interest to map the signal's frequency spectrum along the time domain. However, the optical frequency resolution of this method is typically restricted above the gigahertz range, which represents a critical limitation for applications in real-time spectroscopy, ultrafast detection, imaging and sensing, and, more particularly, for photonic-assisted generation and processing of radio-frequency (RF) signals. Here we propose a new concept for realization of RTFT that involves superposition of multiple signal replicas that are shifted simultaneously along the temporal and frequency domains, leading to an output temporal waveform that effectively maps the input optical spectrum. This configuration overcomes the frequency-resolution limitations of dispersion-based RTFT schemes, while providing the desired signal's spectrum with minimal latency, equal to the inverse of the frequency resolution. We experimentally demonstrate a practical implementation of the concept on optical signals using a frequency shifted feedback (FSF) laser, achieving a frequency resolution of $\simeq$30  kHz and a time--bandwidth product exceeding 400, while the predicted linearity of the frequency-to-time mapping process is shown over a 20~GHz bandwidth. The introduced concept should be of general interest for high-speed, real-time Fourier analysis, beyond the optical-domain implementation reported here; moreover, this work also paves the way for novel applications of FSF lasers in several areas, including high-precision metrology and optical or RF waveform synthesis and processing.},

Here we introduce a physical mechanism to perform machine learning by demonstrating an all-optical diffractive deep neural network (D2NN) architecture that can implement various functions following the deep learning-based design of passive diffractive layers that work collectively. We created 3D-printed D2NNs that implement classification of images of handwritten digits and fashion products, as well as the function of an imaging lens at a terahertz spectrum. Our all-optical deep learning framework can perform, at the speed of light, various complex functions that computer-based neural networks can execute; will find applications in all-optical image analysis, feature detection, and object classification; and will also enable new camera designs and optical components that perform distinctive tasks using D2NNs.},

The opening chapters discuss the Fourier transform property of a lens, the theory and applications of complex spatial filters, and their application to signal detection, character recognition, water pollution monitoring, and other pattern recognition problems. These topics are followed by a computation of the statistical characteristics of the Fourier irradiance patterns and the hybrid systems that combine the best of optics, analog electronics, and digital computers to solve problems. The subsequent chapters examine the pulse-Doppler and chirp signals, the significance of signal-to-noise power spectrum in the information content measurement of photographic film and in image quality determinations. This text also considers the application of nonlinear systems and their components to Fourier optics. The discussions then shift to the application of Fourier methods to the study of spatial information transmission through the human visual system, as well as the application of coherent techniques to vision research. The concluding chapters deal with the well-known pattern recognition problems related to the digital signal processing community. These chapters also look into a general theoretical model of light field propagation from input to output. This book will be of value to optical scientists and vision researchers.},

@misc{opt:Wikipedia.2023,
  abstract = {Fourier optics is the study of classical optics using Fourier transforms (FTs), in which the waveform being considered is regarded as made up of a combination, or superposition, of plane waves. It has some parallels to the Huygens--Fresnel principle, in which the wavefront is regarded as being made up of a combination of spherical wavefronts (also called phasefronts) whose sum is the wavefront being studied. A key difference is that Fourier optics considers the plane waves to be natural modes of the propagation medium, as opposed to Huygens--Fresnel, where the spherical waves originate in the physical medium. 
              
              A curved phasefront may be synthesized from an infinite number of these {\textquotedbl}natural modes{\textquotedbl} i.e., from plane wave phasefronts oriented in different directions in space.  Far from its sources, an expanding spherical wave is locally tangent to a planar phase front (a single plane wave out of the infinite spectrum), which is transverse to the radial direction of propagation.  In this case, a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is created, which emanates from a single spherical wave phase center.  In the near field, no single well-defined spherical wave phase center exists, so the wavefront isn't locally tangent to a spherical ball.  In this case, a Fresnel diffraction pattern would be created, which emanates from an extended source, consisting of a distribution of (physically identifiable) spherical wave sources in space.  In the near field, a full spectrum of plane waves is necessary to represent the Fresnel near-field wave, even locally.  A {\textquotedbl}wide{\textquotedbl} wave moving forward (like an expanding ocean wave coming toward the shore) can be regarded as an infinite number of {\textquotedbl}plane wave modes{\textquotedbl}, all of which could (when they collide with something in the way) scatter independently of one other. These mathematical simplifications and calculations are the realm of Fourier analysis and synthesis -- together, they can describe what happens when light passes through various slits, lenses or mirrors curved one way or the other, or is fully or partially reflected.
              
              Fourier optics forms much of the theory behind image processing techniques, as well as finding applications where information needs to be extracted from optical sources such as in quantum optics. To put it in a slightly more complex way, similar to the concept of frequency and time used in traditional Fourier transform theory, Fourier optics makes use of the spatial frequency domain (kx, ky) as the conjugate of the spatial (x, y) domain. Terms and concepts such as transform theory, spectrum, bandwidth, window functions and sampling from one-dimensional signal processing are commonly used.},
